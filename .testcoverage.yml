# Path to coverage profile file (output of `go test -coverprofile` command).

# For cases where there are many coverage profiles, such as when running
# unit tests and integration tests separately, you can combine all those
# profiles into one. In this case, the profile should have a comma-separated list
# of profile files, e.g., 'cover_unit.out,cover_integration.out'.
profile: coverage.out

# When specified reported file paths will not contain local prefix in the output.
